It is designed to encourage those who are learning Python, usually at school, to try out the Lua and C# languages as well.
In order to make comparisons between the languages, there are some aspects which could be done in a better or different way by those proficient in a particular language.
This is a comparison using methods that work and may not be the best you can get out of the language. Use it as inspiration and make your own improvements as you see fit.
Enjoy
